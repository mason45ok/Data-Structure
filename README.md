# Data-Structure

In the 2024 DS (Data Structures) course, one of the main objectives was using GenAI to control IoT systems. A project extension from this course (ETSH) was awarded the [NSTC-GenAI Stars Excellence Award](https://genaistars.org.tw/2024/award/hackathon/14), and was also showcased by NTNU at the [2024 InnoVEX Exhibition](https://pr.ntnu.edu.tw/ntnunews/index.php?mode=data&id=22618).  
Through practicing course-related content, we became more familiar with applying these concepts, effectively bridging the gap between academia and industry.

## Code

In `python_quickstart.ipynb`, Geminiâ€™s multimodal reasoning capabilities are used to interpret real-time images transmitted by a camera and determine the corresponding intent, which is then used to turn specific devices on or off.  
By applying prompt engineering techniques, the responses from Gemini can be made more stable and adaptable, offering flexible possibilities for expansion. Further exploration of IoT systems enables the development of more user-friendly and diverse system implementations.
